I am a postdoctoral reseacher at the [Statistical Laboratory](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, hosted by [Richard Samworth](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rjs57/). Prior to this, I was a PhD candidate at the [Statistical Laboratory](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, under the supervision of [Rajen Shah](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rds37/). 

My research interests include semiparametric and nonparametric statistics, robust statistics, machine learning, causal inference, clustered data and large-scale data.
